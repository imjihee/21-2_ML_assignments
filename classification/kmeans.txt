 init : {'k-means++', 'random'}, callable or array-like of shape \
            (n_clusters, n_features), default='k-means++'
        Method for initialization:
        'k-means++' : selects initial cluster centers for k-mean
        clustering in a smart way to speed up convergence. See section
        Notes in k_init for more details.
        'random': choose `n_clusters` observations (rows) at random from data
        for the initial centroids.
        If an array is passed, it should be of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        and gives the initial centers.
        If a callable is passed, it should take arguments X, n_clusters and a
        random state and return an initialization.

    n_init : int, default=10
        Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different
        centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of
        n_init consecutive runs in terms of inertia.
